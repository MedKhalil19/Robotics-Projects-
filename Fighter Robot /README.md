# 🤖 Fighter Robot (Combat Robot)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **design and programming of a combat (fighter) robot** based on an **STM32 microcontroller**. The robot uses a **hoverboard (overboard) motor and wheel system as its main drive core**, providing **high torque, robustness, and stability** required for combat robotics.

The system integrates **motor control, power management, and remote operation via an RC controller**, ensuring fast response and reliable maneuverability during aggressive movements.
