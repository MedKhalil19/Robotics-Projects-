# 🤖 All-Terrain Robot – ESP32 Based

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of an **all-terrain mobile robot** powered by an **ESP32 microcontroller**, designed to operate on rough and uneven surfaces. The robot is controlled **in real time via a PlayStation 3 (PS3) Bluetooth controller**, offering smooth and responsive maneuverability.

The system combines **mechanical design, embedded programming, motor control, and wireless communication**, making it a complete **mechatronic solution** suitable for robotics research, education, and prototyping.

## 🧠 System Architecture

### 🔧 Hardware Components
- ESP32 microcontroller  
- High-torque DC motors (e.g., 37GB-550)  
- Motor drivers (dual H-bridge)  
- All-terrain wheels / chassis  
- Power supply (battery + regulation)  

### 💻 Software Components
- ESP32 firmware (Arduino framework)  
- Bluetooth communication with PS3 controller  
- Real-time motor control logic  
- Direction, speed, and motion mapping

## 🎮 Control Scheme
The PS3 controller allows intuitive control of the robot:
- **Analog sticks** → Direction & speed control  
- **Buttons** → Mode switching / special actions (optional)  
- **Real-time response** with minimal latency

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The ESP32 establishes a **Bluetooth connection** with the PS3 controller  
2. Controller inputs are read and processed in real time  
3. Motor commands are generated based on joystick positions  
4. Motor drivers control wheel speed and direction  
5. The robot moves smoothly across different terrains
